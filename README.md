Cart Control Lab
Author: Justin France 

 Lab Assignment- Project Brief
 You have been contracted by CMI (Chase Manufacturing Incorporated) to do some control design for their manufacturing
 assembly line, and particularly on a cart mounted robot which moves back and forth along a track on an automated
 assembly line.
 For each item manufactured, two assembly tasks 100mm apart are performed using the cart mounted robot. The reference
 input is thus a series of step inputs with an amplitude of 100mm and a time t between steps. Each assembly task
 takes 2s to complete in addition to the time taken to position the cart. Equations of motion for the cart and system are
 attached. You will be provided with a laboratory set up of a cart prototype for testing.

 Where I was tasked in designing the control gains to meet the specifications of:  ess < 0.1mm , damping > 0.1, Mp%<30%, tr<05s
